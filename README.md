BasketballAssistant
===================
Majority of code is in BACViewController.m
- Application for iOS devices that allows users to track their stats while practicing their basketball shooting
- Implements a table view to show shot-by-shot data, a picker view that allows users to create custom shot labels, and different themes to customize the app
- Data and theme saves between runs

I developed this application to test what I have learned so far while studying Objective-C and Xcode, especially in regards to how objects work with one another and how certain views(table and picker) work.

Note: In some cases I used NSNumber instead of int when it wasn't necessary, this was so I could get a better feel of how NSNumber works.
